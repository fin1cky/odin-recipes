        <li>1 teaspoon salt, or more as needed</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil, or more as needed</li>
        <li>2 potatoes, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>1 cup crumbled feta cheese</li>
        <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
        <li>salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>1 large egg, beaten</li>
        <li>1 ½ tablespoons butter</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle eggplant slices with salt; set aside for 30 minutes. Rinse and pat dry with paper towels.</li> 
        <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook eggplant and zucchini in hot oil until lightly browned, about 3 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel-lined plate, reserving as much oil as possible in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Add more oil to the skillet if needed and let it get hot. Cook potato slices in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove with a slotted spoon to drain on a paper towel-lined plate, again reserving oil in the skillet.</li>
        <li>Sauté onion and garlic in reserved oil until lightly browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Pour in vinegar, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium-low; cook until liquid is reduced in volume and thick. Stir in tomatoes, lentils, 1/2 of the juice from lentils, parsley, and oregano. Season with salt and black pepper. Cover, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Layer about 1/3 of the eggplant, 1/3 of the zucchini, 1/2 of the potatoes, and 1/2 of the feta in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Pour 1/2 of the tomato mixture over vegetables; repeat layering, finishing with a layer of eggplant and zucchini.</li>
        <li>Cover and bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, make the sauce: Stir milk, flour, and butter for together in a small saucepan; bring to a low boil, whisking constantly, until thick and smooth. Season with nutmeg and black pepper. Remove from heat, cool for 5 minutes, and stir in beaten egg.</li>
        <li>Pour sauce over vegetables and top with Parmesan cheese. Continue baking, uncovered, until sauce is bubbly and top is lightly brown, 25 to 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
